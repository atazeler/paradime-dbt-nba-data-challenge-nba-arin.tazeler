# NBA Draft Analyses
## Introduction
Hello, thank you for being interested in my analyses of some NBA related data, more specifically on NBA draft. I won't be going into what NBA is but for those who are not very familiar with it, NBA draft is a yearly event where teams are selecting young, up and coming talents that declare their intentions to play in NBA. As a big fan of the league, I think the draft system is one of the main reasons why NBA is such a popular league not only in North America but also globally. 

While its not that simple basic system of the draft is like following: 
In the modern NBA by default every team gets 2 draft picks, one for the first round, another for the second round. The worse a team's record is in the year, more likely they will land a higher draft pick in that year's NBA draft. This way the league tries to have some sort of balance in the league so no single team can dominate the league for year after year since that team will be unlikely to find new star talent in the draft as they will be drafting players at lower spots while their current roster ages hence team starts to be less and less successful. 

For general managers (GM) and front offices (FO) of the teams draft is obviously very important and its not only for scouting new talent reasons, because you can trade draft picks with other picks as well as players. Ideally a GM tries to build a team where all of its players' peaks are more or less aligned so your window of championship is as long as possible. For example if you have a young promising core but some older star players, you may wanna rebuild your team by trading your star players for some high draft picks. But doing that you should also consider that a young player probably won't be contributing positively to the team immedately.

In my analyses below im mostly taking the role of a GM building a team and try to come up with some draft strategies.

## Data Sources
My analysis leverages three key NBA datasets from Paradime:
- *PLAYER_GAME_LOGS*
- *TEAM_STATS_BY_SEASON*
- *COMMON_PLAYER_INFO*

## Methodology
### Tools Used
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbtâ„¢.
- **[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)** for data storage and computing.
- **Sigma** for data visualization.

### Applied Techniques
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_player_game_logs_ into seasonal player statistics
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_player_game_logs_ and _stg_common_player_info_ to understand
  playoff and regular season performance by individual players
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_common_player_info_ for insights on NBA players' college backgrounds.
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_team_stats_by_season_ for insights on NBA Teams' historical playoff performance.

## Visualizations
### Team Playoff Appearances
Visualization of playoff appearances for all 30 NBA teams, including their playoff appearance rates.

*Insights:*
The Los Angeles Lakers' dominance in playoff appearances, and the San Antonio Spurs' highest playoff appearance rate.
The Spurs have only missed the playoffs 9 times!

### Player Playoff Games
Assessment of NBA players with the highest number of playoff game wins and their win percentages. The '*' next to NBA Player name indicates if they're 
a member of the [NBA Greatest 75 Team](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-75th-anniversary-team-announced)

*Insights:* 
LeBron James has the most playoff wins of any player, but here's what's most interesting: 
Of the 25 players with the most playoff wins, only 12 of them are members of the [NBA Greatest 75 team](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-75th-anniversary-team-announced). 
There are several players listed that impact playoff wins and compliment their team's best players, but aren't known 
as on the the all time greats, such as: Derek Fisher, Robert Horry, Danny Green. 

### Top Playoff Scorers
Showcases players who achieved the the most points scored in any playoff season.

*Insights:* 
Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant are the only players having three seasons within the top 25 
highest most points scored in a playoff season.

### Top Regular Season Scorers
Highlights NBA players who scored the most in regular seasons.

*Insights:* 
Wilt Champerlain is one of the best regular season scorer of all time. In addition to having the most points scored 
in any regular season ever (4,029), he also has six season in the top 25. The only other player with 6 top 25 seasons is Michael Jordan.
In the chart above, notice that Wilt Champerlain doesn't appear once in the top 25 playoff scorers of all time ðŸ‘€.

### NBA Players by University
Displays which universities have produced the most NBA players.

*Insights:* 
Kentucky has produced the most NBA players in NBA history by a significant margin.... Go Wildcats! Also, this data is [slightly inaccurate](https://erudera.com/resources/colleges-with-most-nba-players/), but that's the NBA API's fault, not mine ðŸ¤£

## Conclusions
This project successfully extracts significant insights from NBA data that NBA fans would find interesting, such as: 

- The dominance of teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs in playoff appearances
- The critical role of "role" players, as highlighted by the playoff games by player insights,
- The extraordinary achievements of players like LeBron James, Michael Jordan in the playoffs, and Wilt Chamberlain in the regular season. 
- The influence of universities like Kentucky in producing NBA talent.
